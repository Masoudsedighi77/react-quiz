# react-quiz
**Welcome to the react-quiz wiki!**

Here this project is a React Quiz Test, that was build by react.js

My main goal of creating this project is to practice my react skills such as useReducer hook and so on

For starting application:
1. Download all file resources in the first layer including src, public, package.json
